###############################
I have done a lot projects related with python.
first, I have done a project to convert scaaned pdf or image to xlsx or csv.
There were strong faint images.
what is important is the accuracy. I had tried to improve the accuracy. 
client got a great profit by my progam.
- second, I have done Named entity recognition (NER) projects.
The project requires data processing, NLP, Machine learning.
I have trained custom entity and gotten NER model for it.
- Third, next project is car velocity tracking.
this is a general project in computer vision and ML. In this project, important thing is roatation of camera. So, common devs can't improve the accuracy.
I have done the project well using yolo and EKF. 
I have done this project for five months.
